Credit card data taken from kaggle
- use linear learner to detect fraud

1) import resources
2) load sagemaker resources (session, roles, s3 buckets)
3) load data from online (creditcard.csv file)

*) specify tuning and balancing hyperparameters when training to build a better
tuned model

- For a tuning a problem, need to determine if accuracy, precision, or recall is more
  important
- For balancing a dataset, if labels are drastically skewed towards one class,
  consider applying a balancing weight hyperparameter to the model
    -> in the credit card fraud example, only 0.1% of the training data was
       labeled as fraudulent, makes it much harder to train

- sagemaker fits in by automating implementing machine learning models
    -> automating the infrastructure to make use of hardware with pre-built
       algorithms

- Can change kernal properties using jupyter lab option in SageMaker's notebook instances
