*** Deployment using Cloud Computing with AWS ***

Examining these questions:
1) What's the machine learning workflow?
2) How does deployment fit into the machine learning workflow?
3) What is cloud computing?
4) Why would we use cloud computing for deploying machine learning models?
5) Why isn't deployment a part of many machine learning curriculums?
6) What does it mean for a model to be deployed?
7) What are the essential characteristics associated with the code of deployed models?
8) What are different cloud computing platforms we might use to deploy our machine learning models?

I) Machine Learning Workflow:
    * Explore and Process Data
        - retrieve
        - clean and explore
        - prepare and transform
    * Modeling
        - develop and train model
        - validate/evaluate model
    * deployment
        - deploy to production
        - monitor and update model and data
