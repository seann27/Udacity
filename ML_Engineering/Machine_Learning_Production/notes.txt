*** Deployment using Cloud Computing with AWS ***

Examining these questions:
1) What's the machine learning workflow?
2) How does deployment fit into the machine learning workflow?
3) What is cloud computing?
4) Why would we use cloud computing for deploying machine learning models?
5) Why isn't deployment a part of many machine learning curriculums?
6) What does it mean for a model to be deployed?
7) What are the essential characteristics associated with the code of deployed models?
8) What are different cloud computing platforms we might use to deploy our machine learning models?

I) Machine Learning Workflow:
    * Explore and Process Data
        - retrieve
        - clean and explore
        - prepare and transform
    * Modeling
        - develop and train model
        - validate/evaluate model
    * deployment
        - deploy to production
        - monitor and update model and data

- endpoint of production environment is defined as the interface to the model
    -> facilitates interaction between application and model
    -> allows application to send user data to model
    -> receives predictions based on input data

- Endpoint and REST API (Application Programming Interface)
    -> REST (Representational State Transfer)
    -> uses HTTP requests and responses
    -> HTTP Request:
        - Endpoint in the form of a URL
        - HTTP Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
        - HTTP Headers (format of data)
        - Message, Data, or Body (User's input data)
    -> HTTP Response
        - HTTP Status Code (if backend processing was successful or contained errors)
        - HTTP Headers, Message/Data/Body
    -> Data is typically transferred as ordered JSON or CSV formatted data
        - requires code to transform and process as needed

- Containers -> computing environment for application and model
    -> Docker is a container, for example
    -> analogy: shipping containers with different products and goods
    -> components:
        - underlying infrastructure (data center or local computer, cluster)
        - operating system
        - container engine (Docker software itself)
        - libraries and binaries required to launch, run, and maintain backend/frontend

- Characteristics of Deployment
    -> model versioning: keeping track of model version metadata in database
    -> model monitoring: once deployed, need to make sure it is living up to performance metrics
    -> model updating and routing: ability to easily update the deployed model
        - routing sends different proportions of user input to model variants for comparisons
    -> model predictions: on-demand and batch
        - on-demand: predictions send back to user in proper format (JSON/XML)
            - provide real-time responses
        - batch: high volume of requests, returns predictions to file
            - aids in business decisions with large amounts of consumer data

- Machine Learning Cloud Platforms
    -> Amazon Web Services (AWS) SageMaker
    -> Google ML Engine
    - AWS has 15 built-in algorithms
    - Automatic hyperparameter tuning
