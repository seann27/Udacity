Intro to Machine Learning Notes
- definition: teaching computers to perform tasks from past experiences
- 3 projects for this course
    a) Find Donors for CharityML with Kaggle
        1) Use population data to figure out what groups of people are most likely to donate
    b) Create an Image Classifier (Deep Learning)
        1) Use PyTorch to develop a NN for classifying images
    c) Creating Customer Segments with Arvato (Unsupervised Learning)
        1) Use demographic data to cluster potential clients for a variety of companies

Intro - setting up environment (python3):
1) Package manager is Anaconda
2) Using Git Bash on Windows (bash emulation for windows command line):
    a) cd into home directory
        i) uninstall and install Git on windows
        ii) make sure git and optional unix tools are checked
    b) pwd to get home directory
    c) anaconda path -> ~/Anaconda3
    d) echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/home/sean/Anaconda3:/home/sean/Anaconda3/Scripts"' >> .bashrc
        i) adds paths to env so Git has access
    e) echo 'alias python="winpty python.exe"' >> .bashrc
        i) required for users of Git Bash
    f) source .bashrc
    g) test everything to make sure it works
        i) conda --version
        ii) python --version
3) Anaconda is cool because it can install non-python packges (unlike pip)
    - download and install anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/download/
        a) $ conda list > lists all packages installed by anaconda
        b) open Anaconda Prompt application
        c) $ conda upgrade conda; $ conda upgrade --all, answer yes
        d) To install packages:  $ conda install numpy scipy pandas
- jupyter notebooks
